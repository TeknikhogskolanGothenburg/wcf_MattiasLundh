Project decision making

*Services
One service has been created that inherits 2 different contracts. This decision has been made in order to get a feel
	for what is possible, in this case the operations are divided into the roles of Administartor and Customer.
	Consumers of the service will now get the operations bundled into these two service client categories via the 
	WSDL generated proxy.

*Exceptions
Exceptions with custom made detail objects have been created, these exceptions are handled on the client side. in 
	this project one such exception is thrown when a non-excistent data record is asked for, the exception will 
	be caught by the client and its custom details will be shown on the UI.

*Bindings
wsHttpBinding is avaliable for all of the opertions to utilize security features that are absent in the basicHttpBinding.
	Security is applied on the wsHttpBinding default Message level.

* SOAP wrapper and collections
There was trouble with setting up message contracts that wrapped collections of data, in the end I decided to reduce the 
	complexity such that the service sends only sigular entities with message wrapping.
